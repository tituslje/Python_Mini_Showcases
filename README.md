# Welcome to my Python Mini Showcases!

Welcome to my little space, where I showcase the stuff that I do in school/online courses/personal interests and other areas of my life, but purely in Python. Not in Anaconda because I don't like that snake (just kidding I just use Visual Studio code).

August 2023 marks my first commit, more to come in future:) Hope everyone that passes by my profile enjoys the Python learning journey as much as I do! In addition, I will be using this repo to show how far I have come since my day 1 "Hello World" script :') A reminder for myself to keep improving and challenging the status quo.

My Python learning journey started off as pure interest, as I heard all the craze about coding and computer science these days. But who knew Python could actually be so fun (and so difficult even though I used it for quite a while already???) My first lengthy script was a Sentiment analyser on Coursera, and I have been practising my coding skills since then. After a month or two, I chanced upon a research opportunity at NTU, which enabled me to use Python as well during my stint as a research assistant. To date, I am still part of the same research group I joined back in August 2021. What I enjoy about coding is its problem-solving aspect, where I combine my technical curiosity with Python, to come up with creative solutions and programs that help others move forward. I also enjoy the creativity that comes with coding, due to the vast number of libraries available on the Internet. 

After practising for a few months, I am very fortunate to score a Summer internship with Micron, where I get to use more Python to create more complicated programs (I am a noobie at that time), and it was a complete treat! More details over at the Micron intern project repository:) Since then, I have been applying my Python skills towards research, automating simple calculations and data collection tasks. Wherever there is an opportunity for an easier way to do things, I turn to Python. Thus, this also led me to think: How can I use Python to solve real-world problems? But on a smaller scale, I intended to use Python to solve some problems that I have always wanted to solve or obtain information through an easier avenue.

**The next few projects I had in mind for the next few months/1 year**:
1. A web crawler that will compile all financial news about a certain ETF, or a certain company I am interested in any day I want it. Good for people who want tailored up-to-date news in 1 place.
2. A PDF/Excel Scraper algorithm for a conventional dataset. Plan to adapt it to a general version so others can use it.
3. Exploring time series models in financial markets, and training my very own model!

**The next few skills I would like to learn from now to 1 year ahead**:
1. Machine Learning with TensorFlow, PyTorch. (Currently taking Coursera courses on the side to learn more) Currently enrolled: Machine Learning Specialization offered by Stanford and DeepLearning.AI
2. Using Polars instead of Pandas (said to be faster)
3. Increasing familiarity with Python in general

## Coursera_mini_projs

So far, I have created a Sentiment analysis script based on a final mini project after learning basic Python on Coursera. This was my very first Python script created as part of a mini project, after learning the language (fun fact). Script is self-explanatory, categorises positive and negative words based on a backlog of common words, and assigns a positive and negative score depending on the word type. At the end, a plot is generated which shows the number of words in each positive/negative score number.

**Improvements: A histogram/pie chart can improve the plot type. Will be implementing it soon.**

## Computational_Catalysis_Research

I am proud to put this here on my Github, as it is my research interest and I am heavily invested in this area. I would like to thank **Asst. Prof. Tej Salil Choksi** and **Lavie Rekhi (Ph.D.)** for their guidance and patience thus far.

This project takes a computational approach to my interest in recent sustainability projects related to carbon capture and sequestration. More specifically, multiple catalysts of different materials are being explored in hopes of converting some reactions to be industrially viable. Said reactions can potentially take in carbon from CO2, and convert it into useful products in the chemical industry. This can help in decarbonising a fraction of processes in the chemical industry.  

For a brief background of the project, feel free to check out the 'background' subfolder where I store my poster and report! In 2023, starting August my task will mainly be creating Python scripts for data visualisation and training computational models to ensure that research work by the graduate students can be accelerated. A publication is also in the working as well. 

***UPDATE 27/8/2023***

The Python script is mainly to create a heatmap that showcases different structures of the surface material of a catalyst, Titanium Carbide. However, it is still incomplete. (~70% completion)

Additional path forwards:
1. Allow for varying pressure as well in finer intervals 
2. Organise code better for clearer display

**Note: Version numbers of files are as such: V0, V1, V2, V3... (V0 is not labelled on the file name at all)**
