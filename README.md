# Welcome to my Python Mini Showcase!

Welcome to my little space, where I showcase the stuff that I do in school/online courses/personal interest and other areas of my life, but purely in Python. Not in anaconda because I don't like that snake (just kidding I just use visual studio code).

August 2023 marks my first commit, more to come in future:) Hope everyone that passes by my profile enjoys the Python learning journey as much as I do! In addition, I will be using this repo to show how far I have come since my day 1 "Hello World" script :') A reminder for myself to keep improving and challenging the status quo.

My Python learning journey started off as pure interest, as I heard all the craze about coding and computer science these days. But who knew Python could actually be so fun (and so difficult even though I used it for quite awhile already???). My first lengthy script was a Sentiment analyser on Coursera, and I have been practicing my coding skills since then. After a month or two, I chanced upon a research opportunity in NTU, which enabled me to use Python as well during my stint as a research assistant. Up to date, I am still part of the same research group I joined back in August 2021, shout out to **Asst. Prof Tej Salil Choksi** for supporting me and your guidance thus far!!!

After practicing for a few months, I am very fortunate to score a Summer internship with Micron, where I get to use more Python to create more complicated programs (I am a noobie at that time), and it was a complete treat! More details over at the Micron intern project repository:) Since then, I have been applying my Python skills towards research, automating simple calculations and data collection tasks, which I will not share here since I feel they are really simple (this repo is for my more complicated scripts, in my opinion). Wherever there is an opportunity for an easier way to do things, I turn to Python. Thus, this also led me to think: how can I use Python to solve real world problems, and enable a better digital future for the next generation?

**The next few projects I had in mind the next few months/1 year**:
1. A web-crawler that will compile all financial news about a certain ETF, or a certain company I am interested in any day I wanted it.
2. A PDF/Excel Scraper algorithm (made them during my intern at Exxon, but I left the files back there:/)
3. Exploring time series models in financial markets, and training my very own model! (Finally putting my Econometrics background to use)

**The next few skills I would like to learn from now to 1 year ahead**:
1. Machine Learning with TensorFlow, PyTorch.
2. Using Polars instead of Pandas (said to be faster)
3. Increasing familiarity with Python in general

## Coursera_mini_projs

So far, I have created a Sentiment analysis script based on a final mini project after learning basic Python on Coursera. This was my very first Python script created as part of a mini project, after learning the language (fun fact). Script is self explanatory, categorises positive and negative words based on a backlog of common words, and assigns a positive and negative score depending on the word type. At the end, a plot is generated which shows the number of words in each positive/negative score number.

**Improvements: Plot type can be improved with a histogram/pie chart. Will be implementing it soon.**
