# Welcome to my Python Mini Showcases!

Welcome to my little space, where I showcase the stuff that I do in school/online courses/personal interests and other areas of my life, but purely in Python. Not in Anaconda because I don't like that snake (just kidding I just use visual studio code).

August 2023 marks my first commit, more to come in future:) Hope everyone that passes by my profile enjoys the Python learning journey as much as I do! In addition, I will be using this repo to show how far I have come since my day 1 "Hello World" script :') A reminder for myself to keep improving and challenging the status quo.

My Python learning journey started off as pure interest, as I heard all the craze about coding and computer science these days. But who knew Python could actually be so fun (and so difficult even though I used it for quite a while already???) My first lengthy script was a Sentiment analyser on Coursera, and I have been practising my coding skills since then. After a month or two, I chanced upon a research opportunity at NTU, which enabled me to use Python as well during my stint as a research assistant. To date, I am still part of the same research group I joined back in August 2021.

After practising for a few months, I am very fortunate to score a Summer internship with Micron, where I get to use more Python to create more complicated programs (I am a noobie at that time), and it was a complete treat! More details over at the Micron intern project repository:) Since then, I have been applying my Python skills towards research, automating simple calculations and data collection tasks. Wherever there is an opportunity for an easier way to do things, I turn to Python. Thus, this also led me to think: how can I use Python to solve real-world problems? But on a smaller scale, I intended to use Python to solve some problems which I have always wanted to solve, or obtain information through an easier avenue.

**The next few projects I had in mind for the next few months/1 year**:
1. A web crawler that will compile all financial news about a certain ETF, or a certain company I am interested in any day I wanted it.
2. A PDF/Excel Scraper algorithm for a conventional dataset.
3. Exploring time series models in financial markets, and training my very own model!

**The next few skills I would like to learn from now to 1 year ahead**:
1. Machine Learning with TensorFlow, PyTorch.
2. Using Polars instead of Pandas (said to be faster)
3. Increasing familiarity with Python in general

## Coursera_mini_projs

So far, I have created a Sentiment analysis script based on a final mini project after learning basic Python on Coursera. This was my very first Python script created as part of a mini project, after learning the language (fun fact). Script is self-explanatory, categorises positive and negative words based on a backlog of common words, and assigns a positive and negative score depending on the word type. At the end, a plot is generated which shows the number of words in each positive/negative score number.

**Improvements: Plot type can be improved with a histogram/pie chart. Will be implementing it soon.**

## Computational_Catalysis_Research

I am proud to put this here on my Github, as it is my research interest and I am heavily invested in this area. I would like to formally thank **Asst. Prof Tej Salil Choksi** and **Lavie Rekhi (PhD)** for their guidance and patience thus far.

For a brief background of the project, feel free to check out the 'background' subfolder where I store my poster and report! Currently in 2023, starting August my task will mainly be creating a Python script and training computational models to ensure that research work by the graduate students can be accelerated. A publication is also in the working as well. 

***Work in Progress***
The Python script is mainly to create a heatmap that showcases different structures of a surface material of a catalyst, Titanium Carbide. However, it is still incomplete.

Additional path forwards:
1. Make sure the colours on the heatmap reflect the surface number configuration correctly.
2. If the number of unique surface configurations >=5, use a colour bar to represent the various surfaces. If the number <5, use a legend instead of a colour bar.
3. Code Optimisation to decrease runtime.
